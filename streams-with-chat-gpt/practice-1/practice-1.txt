The Node.js platform itself is billed as a solution for writing fast and scalable network applications. To write network-oriented software, you need to understand how networking technologies and protocols interrelate. Over the course of the next section, we explain how networks have been designed around technology stacks with clear boundaries; and furthermore, how Node implements these protocols and what their APIs look like. In this chapter you’ll learn about how Node’s networking modules work. This includes the dgram, dns, http, and net modules. If you’re unsure about network terminology like socket, packet, and protocol, then don’t worry: we also introduce key networking concepts to give you a solid foundation in network programming.

Over the course of the next section, we explain how networks have been designed around technology stacks with clear boundaries; and furthermore, how Node implements these protocols and what their APIs look like. In this chapter you’ll learn about how Node’s networking modules work. This includes the dgram, dns, http, and net modules. If you’re unsure about network terminology like socket, packet, and protocol, then don’t worry: we also introduce key networking concepts to give you a solid foundation in network programming.
